This mod enables "raffles" to take place. Raffles reward the winner with a reenforcement card worth X armies which can be increased or decreased by up to Y armies. The chance of which raffles occurring in a turn is customizable. "Mega raffles" can also happen. These are like regular raffles but multiply the reward by Z. The chance of a raffle becoming a mega raffle is customizable. All players (and AIs) are automatically entered into a raffle when one is available.

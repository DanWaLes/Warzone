This mod randomly generates the games settings.
The map and bonus values are not changed.
If there is a custom scenario, it is not changed and neither will distribution settings.
The number of players/teams as well as boot times are also not changed.
The following settings are optional to randomize: luck modifier, kill rates, one army stands guard, commerce, distribution mode, visibility of cards held/received, visibility of cards played, allowing use of fogs higher than normal fog.
Note that mods can't read or write other mod's settings. If you would like to include random mods you will need to do that yourself.

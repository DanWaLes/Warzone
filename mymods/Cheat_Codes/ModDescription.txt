This mod enables earning a card by correctly guessing a cheat code (a number which is X digits long using numbers 0-9). All enabled cards can be earned by using a cheat code. Everyone gets to see when a cheat code is used, but not what the cheat code is. Each player is allowed to guess up to Y cheat codes per turn. Which codes are guessed can be seen by players in the same team or public. Which codes are solved can be seen by players in the same team or public.

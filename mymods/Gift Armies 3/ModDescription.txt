This mod allows players to gift a customizable amount of armies between two connected territories (owned by you and someone else). Gifting armies happens during the attack/transfer phase. If you no longer own the territory you wanted to send armies from then the armies won't be sent. If someone else captured the territory you wanted to gift the armies to no longer owns the territory then the armies won't be sent. If the amount of armies you wanted to gift is higher than the amount actually on the territory then as much armies as possible will be sent.

Special units are supported. If a unit is not allowed to be transfered to teammates (like if it's a type of boss or is a commander) then it wont be transfered. If a unit you wanted to transfer is killed or has moved elsewhere by the time of gifting armies, then a similar unit will be gifted instead. Similar units meaning created by same mod and has same image file name.

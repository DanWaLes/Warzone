This allows all cards that are being used in a game to be earned by using a cheat code. Cheat codes can be solved buy hiring hackers who work in a office to guess them. Every player can see when a cheat code is used, but only team members see which cheat code was used. Teammates can use cheat codes that their teammates have solved.
Hackers can be upgraded (Trainee, Junior, Mid-level, Senior and Lead). Each upgrade makes a hacker guess more cheat codes. Number of guesses a hacker can make is based on round(((10 ^ cheat code length) / trainee hacker guesses per turn) * N). N starts at 1 and each upgrade increases N by 0.25. If all combinations of cheat codes have been guessed by a team, the team's hackers and offices are sold for Sell % of the total cost spent on them.

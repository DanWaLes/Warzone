This mod skips all attacks AIs make on human players. You can choose if AIs can make transfers, attack other AIs and if they can attack neutrals.
Note that this mod only understands built-in teams and not alliances made by mods.
This mod should not be mixed with Advanced Diplo Mod v4 as it has its own AI settings and fully understands the teams associated with that mod.

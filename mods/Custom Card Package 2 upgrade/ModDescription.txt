This mod adds a new custom cards to the game:
- Immobilize Card
- Reconnaissance+ Card
- Recycle Card
- Trap Card
- Rushed Blockade

Playing an Immobilize Card prevents attacks/transfers and airlifts to and from a territory. The territory must be one of yours or connected to one of yours.

A Reconnaissance+ Card is like a normal Reconnaissance Card, but with a customizable range and can be automatically randomly played.

Playing a Recycle Card sets the number armies on a territory of your choice that belongs to you to be the amount that was on it on the first turn, and changes the owner to neutral. The armies that used to be on the territory get added to your income.

A Rushed Blockade Card is similar to Blockade Cards but happen during the attacks phase. Allows you to attack a territory then blockade it during the same turn. Can also be used like a regular Blockade Card.

A Trap Card is similar to Blockade Cards but triggered by an enemy capturing the territory where the card was played. Trap Cards must be played on one of your own territories.

This is reusable code for generating [TerritoryModification orders](https://www.warzone.com/wiki/Mod_API_Reference:TerritoryModification) that turn player territories neutral and the option of removing all special units belonging to them. The territory modifications can later be added to a [GameOrderEvent](https://www.warzone.com/wiki/Mod_API_Reference:GameOrderEvent).

* `eliminate(playerIds, territories, removeSpecialUnits, isSinglePlayer)`
  * Note: this function requires the use of [server version 5.22 or later](https://github.com/DanWaLes/Warzone/tree/master/mods/libs/version) to make territory modifications that remove special units if there are any special units that should be removed
  * Arguments:
    * `playerIds` - array of [PlayerID](https://www.warzone.com/wiki/Mod_API_Reference:PlayerID) - the players to eliminate
    * `territories` - [GameStanding.Territories](https://www.warzone.com/wiki/Mod_API_Reference:GameStanding) - a reference to the territories in the game
    * `removeSpecialUnits` - boolean - decides if all special units belonging to players in `playerIds` can be removed

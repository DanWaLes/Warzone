This mod is designed to only be used by map makers/testers. The map must be in the testing phase.
Attacks are issued from every territory in alphabetical order.
Each player has 1 or 0 territories at any given point. For the game to take fewer turns to end, include more players.
Settings are adjusted to make this run.
Do not mix this mod with any others otherwise this mod may not behave correctly.
Is easier to use Autopilot (Game > Autopilot; hotkey: U) than commit with no orders.
Attacks from same territory are done back to back. Go through the game history one order at a time to ensure no connections are missing or invalid.
